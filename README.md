# Routegadget 2

## Latest news
Version 1.5.2 was released on 13th October 2018 and is installed on all routegadget.co.uk sites.

This includes some tidying up and minor enhancements that may be useful:

* Results are simplified so you don't end up with an extra GPS result listed. Thanks to Roy Heselden for suggesting this. It is something that I had never really thought about, but now looks a lot more sensible than the old way.
* You can now select replay of routes from the Course tab. Thanks to Olav Kvittem for the suggestion.
* Debug mode re-enabled for people who want to build and test their own version.
* Facebook and Twitter removed since they loaded a lot of extra files and I'm not sure anyone was using the links.
* The manager gives a warning if controls are not adjusted when setting up an event on a non-georeferenced map.

## What is RouteGadget?
Routegadget is a Web application for drawing and comparing orienteering routes. The original version was developed by Jarkko Ryypp√∂, and it is now used by orienteering clubs around the world.

## Why Routegadget 2?
The original Routegadget makes extensive use of Java, and this has caused increasing difficulties.
Routegadget 2 allows you to view existing Routegadget information in any modern (HTML5-compliant) browser without the need for Java. It also adds a modern user interface as well as updated functionality for analysis.
